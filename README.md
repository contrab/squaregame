# squaregame
A simple whack-a-mole game for Arduino.

Uses the Adafruit Trellis (and library) for a 4x4 matrix of buttons and LEDs to provide the game's interface.

Uses the MelodyPlayer library to play melodies and notes. (MelodyPlayer is found here: https://github.com/contrab/MelodyPlayer )

Still a work in progress, but as of 2/4/17 the game is playable and a reasonable challenge to the 6-year-olds it was tested on. :-)

My first "real" Arduino program that actually does something interactive. Still feeling out what this thing is capable of... Lots of fun!
