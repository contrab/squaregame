# squaregame
A simple whack-a-mole game for Arduino.

Uses the Adafruit Trellis (and library) for a 4x4 matrix of buttons and LEDs to provide the game's interface.

Uses the MelodyPlayer Arduino library to play melodies and notes. (MelodyPlayer is found here: https://github.com/contrab/MelodyPlayer )

Uses the Sparkle Arduino library to manage the LEDs. (Sparkle is found here: https://github.com/contrab/Sparkle )

Still a work in progress, but the game is playable and a reasonable challenge to the 6-year-olds it was tested on in easy mode, and even a little challenge to adults in hard mode.

My first "real" Arduino program that actually does something interactive. Still feeling out what this thing is capable of... Lots of fun!
